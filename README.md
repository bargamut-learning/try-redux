cd try-redux
npm i
```

```
git clone git@github.com:bargamut-learning/try-redux my-project
cd my-project
npm i
```

## Usage

### Development server

```bash
npm start
```

You can view the development server at `localhost:8080`.

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

This will start editorconfig checker for linting files

### Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

This will start linting script and then run tests

#### Coverage

```bash
npm rut test::coverage
```

This will start tests with coverage report

> Note: If you wish to send coverage report to coveralls.io you must define the `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` in secret environment variable

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```
